# Pig-Game
A game where the player with the highest score wins. 

Player one rolls a dice and gets a current score based on the dice, so if the dice is 5, then player one gets "current" score of 5. Player one can keep rolling the
dice and get the score of the dice added to its current score. However, if player one rolls a dice of 1 then the current score gets reset to 0. Therefore, player one
has to be careful of when to use the "hold" button. The "hold" button basically stores the current score and adds it to the overall score. Once the "hold" button is pressed then it switches to player two. And the same rules applies to player two. Whoever player gets an "overall" score of 100 or more, wins the game!
